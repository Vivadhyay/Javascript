//closure.. a function ran, the function executed, it never gonna execute again but it's going to remember that there are refrences to those variables so the child scope always has access to parent scope. but parent not always has access to child scope..

// The two elements of a pure function?
// 1. Deterministic --> always produces the same results given the same inputs
// 2. No Side Effects -->  It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a programâ€™s execution. It must only depend on its input elements.
